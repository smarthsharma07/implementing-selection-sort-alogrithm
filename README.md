# Selection Sort Implementation (In-Place Sorting)

This repository contains a clean and well-commented implementation of the **Selection Sort** algorithm in Python.  
Selection Sort is one of the simplest comparison-based sorting algorithms and is often used to teach fundamental algorithmic thinking.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate understanding of:
- Iterative algorithms  
- In-place sorting  
- Finding minimum elements through scanning  
- Time complexity of nested loops  
- Sorting without using Python's built-in `sort()` or `sorted()` methods

## 🚀 Features
- Pure Python implementation  
- Sorts the list **in-place**  
- No built-in sorting functions used  
- Deterministic output (same input → same output every time)  
- Beginner-friendly, readable code

## 📦 Selection Sort Overview

Selection Sort divides the list into two parts:

1. **Sorted section** (built from left to right)  
2. **Unsorted section**

At each step:

1. Scan the unsorted portion to find the **smallest** element  
2. Swap it with the first unsorted position  
3. Expand the sorted region by one position  
4. Repeat until the entire list is sorted
